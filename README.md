# ACE OSG 
Scripts and notes for running bioinformatics workflows on [OSG](https://osg-htc.org/).

- Make individual folders for a particular tool or type of analysis.  
- Examples of files to share:
  - htcondor submit files
  - executable shell scripts
  - scripts that prepare data for htc job submission (e.g. downloading or chunking data; making directories to organize outputs)
  - Dockerfiles and links to containers you have built
  - notes (make a README.md in the folder or other markdown file) for how to use the scripts and other advice for working with specific tools/data types on OSG (e.g. tool X uses Y amount of memory).
  - any other files that would be useful for others to run a similar analysis.
